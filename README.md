Dear Hiring Manager

There are several issues that i found while doing automation testing in website https://www.phptravels.net

   1. For Problem A, there is no hotel for destination = Bandung so i replace it with destination = Istanbul.
   2. Cannot get an object in several features while doing automation testing using katalon.
   3. For many times when i do automation testing, the website cannot access.

And here i share about test scenario which i use to do testing.
